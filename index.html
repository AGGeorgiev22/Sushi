<p class="p"><b> Robots in the medical field transform surgeries, supply delivery, and disinfection, allowing providers to focus on patient care. AI-enabled computer vision and data analytics have expanded medical robots' capabilities beyond surgical assistance. They support healthcare workers and enhance patient care in operating rooms and clinical settings. Robotics and automation automate tasks in research laboratories, enabling faster discoveries. Streamlined workflows and risk reduction benefit areas like infection control and medicine distribution. As technology evolves, robots will become more autonomous, freeing up healthcare workers for direct patient care.ะบ</b></p>
