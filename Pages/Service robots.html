   <p class="p"> <b>Service robots relieve healthcare workers by handling routine tasks and logistical operations. These autonomous robots set up patient rooms, track supplies, file purchase orders, restock medical cabinets, and transport linens. By delegating these tasks to robots, healthcare workers can focus on immediate patient needs, increasing job satisfaction. The TUG Robot by Aethon is an example of a service robot that navigates complex environments to deliver linens on a scheduled or on-demand basis.Service robots also contribute to cleaning and disinfection efforts. Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) equipped with ultraviolet (UV) light, hydrogen peroxide vapors, or air filtration systems can sanitize reachable areas uniformly. Akara, a startup, is testing an autonomous mobile robot prototype that uses UV light to disinfect contaminated surfaces, aiding hospitals in their fight against COVID-19.</b></p></b> </br>
