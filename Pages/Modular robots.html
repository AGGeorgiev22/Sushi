    <p class="p"><b>Modular robots enhance other systems and can be configured to perform multiple functions. In healthcare, these include therapeutic exoskeleton robots and prosthetic robotic arms and legs.Therapeutic robots can help with rehabilitation after strokes, paralysis, or traumatic brain injuries or with impairments caused by multiple sclerosis. A wheelchair-mounted robotic arm currently being developed by Intel and Accenture aims to assist patients with spinal injuries in performing daily tasks. When robots are equipped with AI and depth cameras, they can monitor a patientâ€™s form as they go through prescribed exercises, measuring degrees of motion in different positions and tracking progress more precisely than the human eye. They can also interact with patients to provide coaching and encouragement.</b></p>  </br>
