    <div class="Benefits"><b>Using robotics in the medical field improves patient care, enhances clinical processes, and ensures a safe environment for patients and healthcare workers.Patient Care: Medical robots support minimally invasive procedures, frequent monitoring for chronic diseases, intelligent therapeutics, and social engagement for elderly patients. This enables nurses and caregivers to provide more empathy and human interaction, promoting long-term well-being.Clinical Workflows: Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) simplify tasks, reduce physical demands, and ensure consistent processes. They address staffing shortages by managing inventory and timely orders, ensuring supplies are available where needed. Cleaning and disinfection AMRs expedite room sanitization, allowing workers to focus on patient-centric tasks.Safe Environment: AMRs transport supplies, reduce pathogen exposure, and limit hospital-acquired infections. Social robots assist with heavy lifting, reducing strain on healthcare workers.Surgical-Assistance Robots: Advanced surgical-assistance robots enhance surgical precision, speed, and accuracy. They utilize AI and computer vision, with potential for autonomous task completion, allowing surgeons to oversee procedures remotely.In summary, robotics in healthcare enhance patient care, streamline clinical workflows, and create a safe work environment. Surgical-assistance robots provide precise surgical support in two main categories.</b></div>
