    Minimally invasive surgeries for the torso: These include procedures like robotic hysterectomy, robotic prostatectomy, and bariatric surgery, focusing on soft tissues. Surgical robots are inserted through small incisions, providing a stable platform for remote-controlled surgeries and reducing complications.
    Orthopedic surgeries: Robots can be programmed for knee and hip replacements. Integrating smart robotic arms, 3D imaging, and data analytics, these robots offer predictability by assisting surgeons within defined boundaries. AI modeling provides precise guidance for specific orthopedic procedures. Surgical robotics enables collaboration among specialists through video feeds, incorporating AI to differentiate tissue types and avoid sensitive areas. High-definition 3D computer vision enhances surgical performance. In the future, robots may handle subprocedures like suturing under surgeon supervision. Robotic technology plays a vital role in surgeon education, with AI and virtual reality-based platforms offering training for surgical robotics. Surgeons can refine their skills using robotics controls in a virtual environment.
